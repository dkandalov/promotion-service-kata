# Promotion Service Kata

The promotion service calculates discounts for promoted items.
(It's a bit crazy because it's also reducing the tax 🙄)
The `Item` class is a classic DTO and its fields are not encapsulated.

## Your Task

Make `Item` a rich object and encapsulate its fields 💪
Use existing unit tests to make sure things are still working.

Bonus: Make `Item` immutable.
